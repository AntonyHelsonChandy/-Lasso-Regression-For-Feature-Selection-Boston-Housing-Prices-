# -Lasso-Regression-For-Feature-Selection-Boston-Housing-Prices-
<h3>Objective:</h3>
In this analysis we try to use lasso regression to discover the most suitable explanatory attributes that influence the prices of housing. Of these, medv is the response variable while the other 13 variables are possible predictors. At the end of the analysis, we will arrange the top five attributes based on the strength of its influence on the response (medv).
