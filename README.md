# -Lasso-Regression-For-Feature-Selection-Boston-Housing-Prices-
<u><h3>Objective:</h3></u>
In this analysis we try to use lasso regression to discover the most suitable explanatory attributes that influence the prices of housing. Of these, medv is the response variable while the other 13 variables are possible predictors. At the end of the analysis, we will arrange the top five attributes based on the strength of its influence on the response (medv).
<u><h3>Lasso Regression:</h3></u>
Using the lasso regression, we can obtain the important features of the dataset, that minimizes prediction error for a quantitative response variable. The lasso does this by imposing a constraint on the model parameters that cause regression coefficients for some variables to shrink toward zero.
